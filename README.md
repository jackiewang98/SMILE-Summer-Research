Our research starts from July 15 to Aug 23.And we mainly focus on using multimodal data to find correlation between retina and cognitive impairment.

## 3. Tutorials for Week 1

**Change of plan: since we started kinda late week, let's start with basic learning with retina and OCT images, which has less land for us to cover. What you need to grab from this week is:**
<br>
1: Basic understanding of the anatomy of the eye and retina. This basic understanding can pay off when you are doing later projects, where you need deeper insights. <br>

<br>
2: Basic understanding of frequency domain-OCT images. All the OCT we can going to work on later are frequency domain-OCT. For these who want to work on Team B, you need to make sure that you understand how to interpret OCT images. Otherwise, you probably won’t even know where you algorithm fails:

<br>
3: How OCT image works. You need to understand it, but no need to be expert on this.<br>

<br>
Again, you are not expected to be an expert of retina. But by this Friday, at least you need to be able to to describe basic structure of eyeball/retina, and has basic understanding of the images you are about to work with.

**For the engineering part:**

<br>
this link will bring you to one of Dr. Fang’s course from last semester.
<br>
Especially, you need to pay attention to Lecture:
<br>3-9, 11-17, and 20,21.
<br>Lecture 3-9 concentrated on filter-based method, while later lectures are concentrated on deep learning techniques.
<br>
If for some topic, you need to find some more lectures to clarify, you can find another course from MIT that is quite helpful
<br>

 Especially, I strongly recommend you to take a look at their lesson for convolutional network (Lecture 3), and generative network (Lecture 4).
